	- Make more levels (minimum we should have 4 ready by Tuesday)
	- The box that asks you if you would like to go full screen should have a taller height (on linux computers - for whatever reason, it pops up with a scroll bar since the font/buttons are too big; adjusting the height should fix this)

	Dan
	- In javascript swing function: players is an array with String keys, but newPlayers is an array with numerical keys (figure out if this is a problem/how javascript deals with this)
	- Disposing of "windows"/clients/threads when they x out of the browser in host/join. If the host leaves in the join/host handler, things are messed up.
	- Ensure only one client per IP Addrress.
	- when a person exits out of the screen it still says theyre ready. do we care enough to change that?

	Beverly
	- is it possible to make it so that clicking on an available room prompts your name and then adds you to that room so that you dont have to do it yourself?

	Brandon

	ANYONE CAN TAKE
	- Error handling in SwingHandler (for TwitterQueries) - how should we handle for the GUI? --> ie: general connection lost
	- Let the user know who hasn't swung yet (get the loading animation to work on Chrome)
	- See what the other person's word is (or at least show this at the end on the score card - maybe a button on the score card that's like "show words" and it will show each players' words")
	- Play again possibility - probably more difficult that it sounds.

	CHECKOUT/TEST
	- I added the feature so you see who is ready in the multiplayer handler - please check it out and let me know if you want to change how it displays/design.  I wasn't exactly sure what to change when you see a player is ready. - Beverly

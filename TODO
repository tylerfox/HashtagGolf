	- Make more levels (minimum we should have 4 ready by Tuesday)
	- The box that asks you if you would like to go full screen should have a taller height (on linux computers - for whatever reason, it pops up with a scroll bar since the font/buttons are too big; adjusting the height should fix this)

	- In javascript swing function: players is an array with String keys, but newPlayers is an array with numerical keys (figure out if this is a problem/how javascript deals with this)
	- Disposing of "windows"/clients/threads when they x out of the browser in host/join. If the host leaves in the join/host handler, things are messed up.
	- Ensure only one client per IP Addrress.

	ANYONE CAN TAKE
	- Error handling in SwingHandler (for TwitterQueries) - how should we handle for the GUI? --> ie: general connection lost
	- Let the user know who hasn't swung yet (get the loading animation to work on Chrome)
	- See what the other person's word is (or at least show this at the end on the score card - maybe a button on the score card that's like "show words" and it will show each players' words")
	- Play again possibility - probably more difficult that it sounds.

	CHECKOUT/TEST
	- I added the feature so you see who is ready in the multiplayer handler - please check it out and let me know if you want to change how it displays/design.  I wasn't exactly sure what to change when you see a player is ready. - Beverly

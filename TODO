TODO:
	Tyler
	- Make more levels (including at least one where the optimal path is not simply a straight line path to the hole)
	- Create level select screen
	- Ball select screen: players shouldn't have the white background?

	GENERAL CLEANUP/CURRENT BUGS TO FIX:

	Brandon
	- Reformat/fix menu buttons to be on all pages (buttons, not links!)
	- small matter: "Uncaught ReferenceError: linedraw is not defined" / random stuff that comes up in the console during gameplay
	- Test whether used words persist past the end of an individual game


	Multiplayer Stuffs
	Dan
	- In javascript swing function: players is an array with String keys, but newPlayers is an array with numerical keys (this should probably be fixed...)
	- Disposing of "windows"/clients/threads when they x out of the browser


	EVERYONE:
	- error handling in SwingHandler (for TwitterQueries) - how should we handle for the GUI? --> General connection lost, how we should deal with this

	"Extras"
	- Display names to balls (ie: like terrain display)
	- Display names in lobby
	- Ensuring only one client from each IPAddress
	- Multiplayer:
		- users continue to watch the game after they have won and then a final popup will tell them the final results of the entire game (how many strokes each player before finishing)
		- Allow players to select their ball color
